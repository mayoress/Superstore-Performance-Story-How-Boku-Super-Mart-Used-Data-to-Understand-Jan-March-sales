Superstore Performance Story: How Boku Super Mart Used Data to Understand Jan-March sales

Introduction
In 2024, Boku Super Mart wanted to understand one thing clearly what drives its performance across cities, products, and customer behaviors?

The company had strong operations in three major cities Naypyitaw, Mandalay, and Yangon and offered a wide range of products, from food and beverages to fashion and electronics. However, sales patterns were inconsistent, and management needed to know why.

To answer that, we built a performance dashboard that brought together key metrics such as gross income, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), customer ratings, and payment preferences.

Story of the Data
Every sale tells a small part of a larger story.
For Boku Super Mart, that story included 1,000 customers, different payment methods, and changing purchase behaviors across cities.

The data showed that Naypyitaw was the highest-performing city, while food and beverages were the best-selling product category. Customers preferred paying with cash, and most gave average to good ratings for their shopping experience.

The challenge wasn’t lack of sales it was about finding patterns and meaning in those numbers.

Problem Statement
Despite steady sales, Boku Super Mart struggled with:

Uneven gross income across months.
Lack of clarity on which products and cities drove profits.
Limited understanding of customer behavior and satisfaction.
Difficulty choosing which payment methods to prioritize for marketing and system upgrades.
Solution
The solution was a data-driven analysis that focused on key performance indicators (KPIs):
✅ COGS (by city, product, and payment method)
✅ Gross income (by month and gender)
✅ Customer type ratings and satisfaction
✅ Payment preferences and purchasing trends

Using these insights, Boku Super Mart could make evidence-based business decisions from marketing to stock management.

Pre-Analysis
Before diving in, the data showed:

A total customer count of 1,000.
Gross income fluctuated monthly, with February being the lowest.
Most customers rated their experience as average (508) or good (481), with only 11 bad ratings.
Cash was the most used payment method, followed by E-wallet and Credit Card.
In-Analysis
1. Monthly Gross Income Trends
January: $5,538
February: $4,629
March: $5,212
Gross income dipped in February, possibly due to seasonal or promotional changes.
2. City Performance
Naypyitaw: COGS $105,304 — highest-performing city
Mandalay & Yangon: around $101,000 each
Naypyitaw’s strong numbers suggest higher demand or better pricing strategy.
3. Product Line Insights
Top Seller: Food & Beverages ($52,498)
Lowest: Health & Beauty ($46,851)
Food drives the highest profit margins, while health products may need targeted marketing.
4. Payment Behavior
Cash: $106,863 — most preferred
E-Wallet: $104,755
Credit Card: $95,969
Cash remains dominant, but the small gap with e-wallets shows a shift toward digital payments.
5. Gender and Income
Males: Slightly higher income in most categories except Food & Beverages and Fashion, where females lead.
This balance highlights an inclusive customer base with shared spending patterns.
Post-Analysis and Insights
Naypyitaw is Boku Super Mart’s strongest market high COGS and steady income.
Food and beverages dominate sales; promotional focus here can boost short-term profits.
Cash payments are still king, but E-wallets are closing in, showing digital adoption growth.
Customer ratings are mostly positive, but Boku should address factors behind “average” feedback to improve loyalty.
Gender-based analysis reveals balanced participation — opportunities exist to personalize promotions for both groups.
